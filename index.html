        <div class='step'>What is it?</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>Nightcode is a simple IDE for Clojure and Java projects targeting the command line, the desktop, the web, Android, and iOS. It's just a standalone jar file that will run anywhere without being installed. Whether you choose to make a Clojure or pure Java project, Nightcode will use its built-in copy of Leiningen to build and run your code.

        <div class='step'>Built-in templates</div>
        <img src='templates.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>After hitting New Project and giving it a name, you'll be presented with ten ready-made templates. The console, game, Android, and iOS templates come in two flavors, Clojure and Java. In addition, there is a desktop template for making <a href='https://github.com/daveray/seesaw'>seesaw</a> apps and a web template for ClojureScript apps. The game templates use <a href='http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/'>LibGDX</a>, and allow you to compile for desktop, Android, and iOS from the same codebase!</div>

        <div class='step'>Keyboard friendly</div>
        <img src='hints.png' class='small-screenshot' />
        <div>Hold down the control key (or command on OS X), and you'll see shortcut hints appear over every applicable widget. Holding it while pressing Up/Down/Enter will move your selection in the project tree and expand/collapse directories. Holding it while pressing PgUp/PgDn will move between recent files, much like tabs in other IDEs but without the UI clutter. Lastly, <a href='http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit.html'>paredit mode</a> can be toggled for Clojure and ClojureScript files via a button above the editor.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Clojure integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>The REPL pane on the bottom-left is a convenient scratchpad to try out Clojure commands. The build pane on the bottom-right gives you access to all the Leiningen commands to run, build, and test your project. Additionally, Clojure files have a 'Doc' button above the editor, which will provide completion suggestions for whatever you're typing thanks to the integrated <a href='https://github.com/alexander-yakushev/compliment'>compliment</a> library. Lastly, if you click on a project.clj file, you'll see a 'Check Versions' button which will run <a href='https://github.com/xsc/lein-ancient'>lein-ancient</a> to look for new versions of your dependencies.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>ClojureScript integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>With the embedded <a href='https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild'>lein-cljsbuild</a> plugin, building ClojureScript projects is supported. Using the provided template, you can build a complete web app using Clojure on the server side and ClojureScript on the client side -- all inside the same project. You'll even find an 'Auto' button in the build pane, which runs lein-cljsbuild's auto rebuild feature so your ClojureScript files rebuild every time you save them.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Android integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>With the embedded <a href='https://github.com/clojure-android/lein-droid'>lein-droid</a> plugin, building Android projects is supported (<a href='http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html'>Android SDK tools</a> required). The "Run" button builds and installs your app on your connected device. The "Build" button creates a release version of the app and lets you sign it. In addition, Android projects have a special "LogCat" item in the sidebar, which will show your device's or emulator's logs.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>iOS integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>With the embedded <a href='https://github.com/oakes/lein-fruit'>lein-fruit</a> plugin, building iOS projects is supported (Mac OS X, Xcode, <a href='http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html'>JDK 7</a>, and <a href='http://www.robovm.org/'>RoboVM</a> are required). The "Run" button builds and runs your app in the simulator. The "Build" button creates a release version of the app that can run on a device.</div>
    </div>
    <div class='section dark'>
        <div class='step'>Java integration</div>
        <div class='sectionbody'>While it is a Clojure-based tool, Nightcode also works with pure Java projects. You can start one with one of the built-in Java templates, or you can import an existing project and it will prompt you to create a project.clj file. You'll need to edit it a little bit so Leiningen knows how to build the project. For most Java projects, you'll get to use the Reload button, which will let you automatically inject newly-saved changes into your running program via Java's HotSwap feature.</div>
